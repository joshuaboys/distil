### 2. Delegate via Codex MCP
Use the Codex MCP server to delegate. The server exposes these tools:

**`mcp__codex__codex`** - Start a new Codex session:
```json
{
  "prompt": "As a [expert type], analyze: [task description]\n\nContext:\n[relevant code/docs]",
  "approval-policy": "on-request",
  "sandbox": "read-only"
}
```

**`mcp__codex__codex_reply`** - Continue an existing session:
```json
{
  "conversationId": "[id from previous response]",
  "prompt": "Follow-up question or clarification"
}
```

### 3. Expert Prompt Templates
