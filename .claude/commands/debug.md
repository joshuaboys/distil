# Debug Issue

## Problem Description

$ARGUMENTS

## Debugging Methodology

### 1. Reproduce the Issue
- Document exact steps to reproduce
- Note environment details
- Identify consistency (always/sometimes)

### 2. Gather Information
- Check logs for errors
- Review stack traces
- Note when the issue started
- Identify recent changes

### 3. Form Hypotheses
Based on evidence, list possible causes:
1. Hypothesis A
2. Hypothesis B
3. Hypothesis C

### 4. Test Hypotheses
For each hypothesis:
- Design a test to confirm/refute
- Execute the test
- Record results
- Update understanding

### 5. Binary Search
If the cause is unclear:
- Identify the boundaries of the problem
- Test the middle point
- Narrow down systematically

### 6. Fix and Verify
- Implement the fix
- Verify the original issue is resolved
- Check for regressions
- Add test to prevent recurrence

## Output Format

```markdown
## Debug Report

### Issue

### Root Cause

### Evidence
How we determined the cause

### Fix Applied
What was changed

### Verification

Never guess. Always gather evidence before concluding.
